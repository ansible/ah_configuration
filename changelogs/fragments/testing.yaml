  - Fixed issue with ah_ee_repository working on newer versions.
  - Fixed issue with ah_namespace delete
  - ah_ee_repository include/exclude tags are no longer mutually exclusive
  - added better error catching to ah_ee_registery_index/sync to handle when a registery is not found.
breaking_changes:
  - Introduces a `sync` option to the ee_repository_sync role on the `ah_ee_repositories` variable which by default is false and which is required true to sync the repository.
  - Removed ah_ee_registry new name option. This affected underlying images indexed from the registery leaving them abandoned, and subsequent indexes of the renamned registery would fail.
